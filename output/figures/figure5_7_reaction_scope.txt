Figure 5.7: Distribution of public versus private reactions, as percent of all reports with a reported reaction.
306 reports.
Public reactions are those published in the media. Private reactions are those documented in US Department of State embassy cables from Wikileaks.
Note: Public face-saving reactions were only relevant in private, as embassies could not report in the media that officials were making efforts to save face.
